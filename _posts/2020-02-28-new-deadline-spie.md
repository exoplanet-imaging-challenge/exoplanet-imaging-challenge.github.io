After receiving feedbacks from the community, and due to the covid crises, we have decided to carry-on the data challenge until the **30th of September 2020**. 
The results of this first phase will be published in an SPIE-conference proceeding (Astronomy Telescope + Instrumentation, San Diego, USA) at the end of the year 2020. 
Every participant will be contacted and invited to co-author the proceeding. 
*In the meantime, have fun !*
