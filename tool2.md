In the [Github repository](https://github.com/exoplanet-imaging-challenge/phase2/tree/main/tutorials) dedicated to the second phase of the <em>Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge</em>, you will find tutorials to help you navigate through the data and to prepare your result files for submission on EvalAI.


* Example on how the data have been reduced (pre-processed / calibrated)
* Procedure to inject the synthetic planetary companions (with limitations)
* Creating a MEF file compatible with the submission format required on EvalAI
