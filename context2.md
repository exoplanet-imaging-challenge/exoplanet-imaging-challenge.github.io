## Characterization of point sources
<p style='text-align: justify;'>In the second phase of the <em>Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge</em>, the focus is exclusively on the <strong>characterization of point-like sources (exoplanets)</strong> within high-contrast images. The provided data are from two ground-based integral field spectrographs: SPHERE-IFS at the Very Large Telescope (ESO, Cerro Paranal, Chile) and GPI at the Gemini-South telescope (Cerro Pach√≥n, Chile). 
The images provided are coronagraphic multispectral images (with a rather low spectral resolving power, R ~50) taken in pupil tracking mode. 
Note that it therefore corresponds to so-called <em>ADI+mSDI</em> data from the phase 1 of the <em>Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge</em> (see related Tabs).</p>

Point source characterization in high-contrast imaging consists in two tasks: <br>
(1) **Astrometry**, that is to say the accurate position of the point source with respect to the star;<br>
(2) **Spectrophotometry**, that is to say the contrast (i.e. brightness ratio) of the point source with respect to the star, for each available wavelength of the multispectral cube of images (spectrum).

<p style='text-align: justify;'> When possible, the extracted values should come with (a) the corresponding 1-sigma uncertainties, and (b) the corresponding posterior distribution used to estimate the value and its uncertainties.</p>
