# Objectives 
## Characterization of point sources
In the second phase of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge, the focus is exclusively on the characterization of point-like sources (exoplanets) within high-contrast images taken with ground-based telescopes. Within point source characterization, there are two tasks: <br>
(1) **Astrometry**, that is to say the position of the point source with respect to the star;<br>
(2) **Spectrophotometry**, that is to say the contrast of the point source with respect to the star, for each available wavelength.

The data provided come from two ground-based high-contrast integral field spectrographs (with a rather low spectral resolving power below 50) and are taken in pupil tracking mode (see Phase 1 for more details).
