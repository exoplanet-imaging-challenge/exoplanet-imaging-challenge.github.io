## Publication of the results 

After the first phase of the exoplanet imaging data challenge (ending 30th of September 2020 at 11.59am CET), the results of the submission have been gathered in an SPIE conference proceeding. This proceeding is the result of a poster presented at SPIE [Astronomical Telescope + Instrumentation](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/astronomical-telescopes-and-instrumentation) taking place online from the 13th to the 18th of December 2020. 

You can find the publication [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05080.pdf) (arXiv version). All participants to the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge have been invited as co-author.
