#### HR 8799 system orbit video ####

The young star HR 8799 hosts four giant gaseous planets ([Marois et al., 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09684.pdf)). The following video shows 10 different epochs of post-processed high-contrast images of the HR 8799 system observed in the near-infrared over a period of 12 years, from 2009 to 2021. Data are taken using the [NIRC2 instrument](https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/) installed at the [Keck Telescope](https://keckobservatory.org/) (Mauna Kea observatory, Hawaii, USA).
