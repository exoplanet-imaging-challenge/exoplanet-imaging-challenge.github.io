<i>In this section, you will find the most relevant scientific publications related to post-processing techniques for high-contrast imaging with ground-based instruments. <em>Please note that the following list is non-exhaustive, if you want your publication to join the list, feel free to contact us.</em></i>

<p> Nowadays, most post-processing is based on <i>differential imaging</i>. This technique consists in estimating the residual starlight (ideally without any circumstellar signal) and subtracting this estimated image from the scientific image. This operation is repeated for all the available high-contrast scientific images of the target. The subtracted images are then combined to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the circumstellar signals (planets and/or disks). In order to estimate the starlight residuals, <i>diversity</i> is required: the circumstellar signals of interest must have a different behavior or properties from those of the starlight noise residuals, so that they can be disentangled. This diversity is usually achieved through specific <i>observing strategies* (e.g. polarization imaging, pupil tracking imaging, reference imaging etc.). </p>

<p>The image below summarizes the four steps of differential imaging towards the detection of exoplanets (or disks) signals.</p>

### Post-processing techniques dedicated to high-contrast imaging ###
The paper presented below correspond to data processing based on Angular Differential Imaging (ADI). The concept of ADI applied to high-contrast imaging has been introduced by [Marois et al., 2006](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/500401/pdf).<br>
In order to use ADI-based techniques, the images are taken in <em>pupil tracking mode</em> during the observation sequence (usually about an hour of observation, with exposure times ranging from milliseconds to minutes). This observing strategy introduces angular diversity: during the whole observation sequence (1) the astrophysical scene rotates around the optical axis (centred on the star) following the parallactic angle, while (2) the pupil (entrance apperture) of the telescope remains fixed, which means that the optical aberrations are kepts in the same direction in the field of view.
<br>
<p>The image below summarizes how typical so-called 'ADI data set' (temporal cube of high-contrast images) are taken.</p>

<center><small><i> From left to right: Pupil-tracking imaging is possible with a telescope equipped with an alt-az mount. The pupil (telescope entrance aperture) remains fixed, i.e. the optical wavefront propagates in the same direction until it is focused in the detector's field of view. Meanwhile, the astrophysical scene rotates in the detector's field of view, following the parallactic angles (dotted white curve). The end result is a temporal image cube in which the residual starlight remains more or less fixed, while the planetary/disk signals have a different position in each temporal image, depending on the parallactic angle. </i></small></center>
