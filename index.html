<p> Welcome to The Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge, a community-wide effort to compare algorithms for detecting exoplanets with ground-based high-contrast imaging. The challenge is organized in collaboration with several members of the high-contrast imaging community and had direct support from the <a href="https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/">Grenoble Alpes Data Institute</a> (Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, France). </p>

<p>Direct imaging is a major step in the hunt of extrasolar planets. But observing exoplanets using ground-based telescopes is a very challenging task! The main difficulties are the huge difference in brightness between the host star and its potential companions and the small angular separation between them. These difficulties are amplified by the image degradation caused by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere and the imperfect optics in the instrument. Therefore, ground-based high-contrast imaging (HCI) relies on the use of adaptive optics, which corrects in real time for the atmosphere turbulence by using a deformable mirror, and coronagraphy, which suppresses most of the light coming from the host star. The following video, prepared by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program, explains the role of coronagraphy and adaptive optics correction in the specific case of space-based observations:  </p>

<p>Even using these cutting-edge technologies, the resulting images suffer from bright starlight residuals hiding the presence of planetary companions. Among them, the quasi-statics *speckles* are of the same size as the exoplanet signal and often brighter. Therefore, the two remaining components of high-contrast imaging are (1) the data acquisition techniques, which focuses on introducing some diversity in the data to later disentangle between the planetary companions and the speckle field and (2) the post-processing techniques that exploit this diversity to carve out further the starlight residuals and recover the planetary signals (see the sub-challenges section below). **Post-processing techniques is what ultimately pushes the performance of the HCI instruments.** </p>

<div class="box-note">You don't need to be an astronomer or expert in high-contrast imaging to participate! We welcome the participation of non-domain experts. On this website you will find extensive documentation about the challenge and how to participate. We expect domain experts will use their tools, for outsiders we have prepared a starting kit in the resources section.</div>

<!-- <p>In the spirit of openness, we exclusively rely on open source tools for conducting this competition: all the contributed datasets (nineteen in total from 5 different instruments) will be released at the end of the competition as well as the results of the challenge. Finally, this challenge is open to anyone who is interested in participating!</p> -->

<!-- <p> In the spirit of openness, we exclusively rely on open source tools for conducting this competition: this website is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/exoplanet-imaging-challenge/exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io">GitHub</a>,
the implementations of the metrics and backend algorithms (Python code) are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/carlgogo/exoimaging_challenge_extras">exoimaging extras repository</a>, and Codalab, a framework for accelerating reproducible computational research, was selected to host the competition. Moreover, our plan is to release all the contributed datasets (nineteen in total from 5 different instruments) at the end of the competition as well as the results of the challenge. Finally, this challenge is open to anyone who is interested in participating!</p>
