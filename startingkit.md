<p style='text-align: justify;'>The procedures to inject synthetic planet signals, count detected point sources and generate ROC curves are included in the open source <a href='https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP'>Vortex Image Processing package</a> for the sake of transparency. Other code related to the data challenge is available at the <a href='https://github.com/carlgogo/exoimaging_challenge_extras'>Data Challenge Extras repository</a>. Here we also share a Python script <mark>DC1_codalab_starting_kit.py</mark> illustrating how to create the outputs to be submitted for participating in the data challenge.</p>
 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>The extras repository also contains a data challenge starting kit, in the form of a Jupyter notebook <mark>DC1_starting_kit.ipynb</mark>, which explains in detail the source counting procedure on detection maps (to get the true and false positives). The starting kit can also be executed on the cloud thanks to <a href='https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/carlgogo/exoimaging_challenge_extras/master'>Binder</a>. This implementation can be used as a reference for future studies on image processing algorithms for direct imaging of exoplanets.</p>
