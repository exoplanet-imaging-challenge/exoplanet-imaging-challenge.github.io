## Publication of the metrics used for the Phase 2 

After setting the second phase of the 'Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge', we gathered the description of the second phase, the challenge design, the data set available and metrics used to make the comparison in an SPIE conference proceeding. This proceeding is the result of an oral contribution presented at SPIE [Astronomical Telescope + Instrumentation](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/astronomical-telescopes-and-instrumentation) taking place from the 17h to the 22th of July 2022 in Montr√©al (Canada). 

You can find the publication [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08120.pdf) (arXiv version). 

All members of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge Phase 2 working group are co-authors.


## Publication of the comparison of the Phase 2 

After the deadline set on 15/04/2024, we will compile the result and publish the comparision 

All participants to the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge Phase 2 are co-authors.
