<i>In this section, we list other data challenges (or blind test) related to exoplanet search.</i>

### Roman Space Telescope Exoplanet Data Challenge ###
The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as WFIRST, Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope), also called Roman Space Telescope (RST) is a 2.4m telescope working in the infrared. The RST is a NASA observatory designed for a 5-year mission, whose launch is foreseen during the mid-2020.
The (RST) Exoplanet Data Challenge aims at looking at several detection techniques (coronagraphy, microlensing...) based on simulated images and data by the RST consortium.

### Starshade Exoplanet Data Challenge ###
The Starshade is an external occulter that, similarly to a coronagraph, hides the glaring light of the target star in order to unveil close-in companions. A starshade is a thin layer of material spread over a diameter of about tens of meter, with a specific outter "flower-like" shape to avoid spurious diffraction effects (like an apodizer). Therefore the technlogical challenge of starshades is that they must be carefully wrapped on ground and deployed in space. 
Moreover, the starshade must be located at tens of thousands of kilometers from the telescope, pushing for another technological challenge in the domain of high accuracy formation flight.
This technology is designed, built and tested by [NASA](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/technology/starshade/) and planned to be co-launched with the Roman Space Telescope for a rendez vous within the first years of operation.

### Interferometry Data Challenge ###
The interferometry community is organizing

### ARIEL Data Challenge ###
ARIEL is a space mission led by whose mission is to. The launch is forescast.

### Precursor high-contrast imaging data challenge ###
In 2012, a group of researcher from the HCI community gathered to organize a [similar initiative](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=c5a8255881e2f986860b4802d61e579ed0ea73f1) with simulated data of GPI and SPHERE.


### Near Campaign at the Very Large Telescope ###
The NEAR campaign aims to search for low-mass planets around both components of the binary a Centauri, the closest stellar system to Earth. 
As such, 100-hour of observations were conducted using a dedicated upgrade of the VLT mid-infrared imager VISIR. 
The NEAR campaign is a collaboration between ESO and the Break-through Initiatives. 
Here, through the data challenge initiative, we propose to offer access to the NEAR campaign data. 
As such, anyone has the possibility of applying the best algorithm on these data and therefore taking part in this fascinating adventure: attempting to image the closest planet to Earth.

A short article published in the ESO Messenger summarizes the NEAR campaign: <https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.178-dec19/messenger-no178-5-9.pdf>

The campaign data can be found [here](<ftp://ftp.eso.org/projects/aosimul/NEAR_Campaign_data/>)

These data are gathered in a serie of .fits files, each consisting of 401x401 images (Primary HDU), and parallactic angle as an ImageHDU. 

Compared to the raw data: 
* the chopping subtraction has already been done, 
* outliers and bad frames were removed, 
* frames are aligned, 
* 500x0.12s frames were combined to 60s time resolution.

For more enquiry about the data or to discuss your results, please contact P. Pathak (<Prashant.Pathak@eso.org>) and M. Kasper (<kasper@eso.org>)
