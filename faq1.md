* How can I participate? Where is the competition? Is this working
> The challenge is hosted on Codalab, a framework for accelerating reproducible computational research used by many researchers in the machine learning and medical imaging communities. You need to follow this [link](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22836) to acces the exoplanet imaging data challenge. If this is your first time on Codalab, please sign up by entering a user name, a password and a valid e-mail address (that's it).  
 
* Can I submit results corresponding to only a subset of the proposed datasets?
> You can participate in either sub-challenge (see the [sub-challenges section](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/subchallenges)) by submitting the detection maps corresponding to each dataset (nine for the first sub-challenge and ten for the second one) and a detection threshold. A partial submission for a given sub-challenge is possible, e.g. five detection maps for the first sub-challenge (instead of nine), but that will penalize the metrics computations and your score (see the [metrics section](https://exoplanet-imaging-challenge.github.io/metrics)). 

* Can I modify or edit a submission?
> No, Codalab does not allow to edit submissions. You just need to resubmit and the new score (if better than the previous ones) will be shown on the scoreboard.
