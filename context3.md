The 3rd phase of the *Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge* is focused on circumstellar disk imaging in total intensity.

The goal is to better understand the effects of high-contrast imaging post-processing on astrophysical scenes showing extended features. 
The next set of high-contrast data will therefore include synthetic circumstellar disks with a variety of features that were found in high-contrast images over the last few years: gaps, shadows, spirales, embeded companions etc.

**Timeline:**
We plan to have the data ready and publish their properties and characteristics at the next **[SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/astronomical-telescopes-and-instrumentation)** conference taking place in Copenhagen (Denemark) from the 5th to 10th of July 2026. 
Abstracts are due on December 3rd 2025.
