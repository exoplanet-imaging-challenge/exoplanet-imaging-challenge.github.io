## Publication of the results 

After the first phase of the exoplanet imaging data challenge (ending 30th of September 2020 at 11.59am CET), the results of the submission have been gathered in an SPIE conference proceeding. This proceeding is the result of a poster presented at SPIE [Astronomical Telescope + Instrumentation](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/astronomical-telescopes-and-instrumentation) taking place online from the 13th to the 18th of December 2020. 

You can find the publication [here] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05080.pdf) (arXiv version). All participants to the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge have been invited as co-author.

## Future of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge

We intend to regularly launch different phases of this data challenge, and make it evolve to include more features. Next steps will be (1) the planet characterization in terms of contrast and position estimation and (2) the detection of circumstellar disks.

The idea is to publish the results every two years, under the form of an SPIE *Astronomical Telescope + Instrumentation* proceeding.

The data will be available permanently on the Zenodo repository so that anyone can test her/his algorithm on these data set and compare it to the published results.
